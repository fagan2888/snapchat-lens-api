## Snapchat Lens API

Snapchat Lenses include a scripting library for creating rich interactive experiences. With scripts, Lenses can respond to touch input, play animation and audio, modify Scene Objects, etc.

Snapchat provides a Javascript interpreter and exposes a number of variables and classes, which are documented in the [official API documentation](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/api/).

> This type definition builds upon the official API, which it re-packages in a format that's easy to consume by production-grade applications.
